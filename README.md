* [OpenText NetIQ Identity Governance](https://www.opentext.com/products/netiq-identity-governance) REST API
* API stubs generated by using [api-spec-converter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/api-spec-converter) via [docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/ioggstream/api-spec-converter) and [Swagger CodeGen CLI](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.swagger.codegen.v3/swagger-codegen-cli)
